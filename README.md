# RRC effect on BPSK and QPSK
This is a MATLAB simulaion of the effect of Root Raised Cosine pulse shaping on BPSK and QPSK modulations

Simulation contains 5 types of analysis and plots: 
  - Signals after pulse shaping
  - PSD of signals
  - Eye diagrams
  - BER analysis
  - Scatter plots


In the "REPORT" repo you can find the a review of codes and details along with plots.
